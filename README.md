# halo

A Turborepo monorepo that deploys as one Cloudflare Worker. Astro serves the
site, Hono serves the API at `/api`, and both run on the same origin.

```

The site imports the API and mounts it in `src/pages/api/[...path].ts`. One
build, one deploy, one origin. Same-origin removes CORS and keeps session
cookies on `SameSite=Lax`.

## First run

1. Install the dependencies.

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Create the database.

```bash
createdb halo
```

3. Copy the environment files.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp apps/web/.dev.vars.example apps/web/.dev.vars
```

4. Write a secret into `apps/web/.dev.vars`.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

5. Set `localConnectionString` in `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` to your local
   Postgres. Miniflare needs a password in the URL, even with `trust` auth.

6. Apply the schema.

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

7. Start the stack.

```bash
pnpm dev:all
```

- Site and API: http://localhost:4321
- API reference: http://localhost:4321/api/reference
- Email preview: http://localhost:3001

## Environment

Two sources, because two runtimes read them.

- `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` holds the bindings and the plain variables. The
  Worker reads them.
- `apps/web/.dev.vars` holds the local secrets. Never commit this file.
- `.env` at the root holds `DATABASE_URL` for drizzle-kit only. The Worker does
  not read it.

`@t3-oss/env-core` validates the Worker variables in `packages/api/src/env.ts`.
A missing or short secret stops the request with a clear message.

Put a production secret with:

```bash
pnpm cf:secret BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
```

## Deploy

1. Create a Hyperdrive config against your production Postgres.

```bash
pnpm cf:hyperdrive -- --connection-string="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/halo"
```

2. Copy the returned id into `hyperdrive[0].id` in `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`.

3. Put the secrets.

```bash
pnpm cf:secret BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
pnpm cf:secret RESEND_API_KEY
```

4. Apply the migrations against production, then deploy.

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." pnpm db:migrate
pnpm deploy
```

## Security

The API applies these on every request:

- **Headers**: a `default-src 'none'` content security policy, `nosniff`,
  `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `no-referrer`, and HSTS in production. The Scalar
  page gets a wider policy because it loads a CDN bundle.
- **CSRF**: `hono/csrf` rejects a cross-origin form post. JSON requests are
  covered by the same-origin rule.
- **Body limit**: 64 KB.
- **Rate limit**: the Cloudflare rate limit binding, keyed on
  `CF-Connecting-IP`. The edge sets that header, so a client cannot forge it.
- **Auth**: Better Auth adds its own limits, 5 sign-ins per minute and 10
  sign-ups per hour. Passwords are 12 characters or more.
- **Cookies**: `HttpOnly` always. `Secure` when `ENVIRONMENT` is `production`.
- **Errors**: the handler returns a request id, never the internal message.

Two controls change with the environment, because a strict value blocks local
work:

| Control        | Development | Production                     |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| HSTS           | off         | on                             |
| Secure cookies | off         | on                             |
| API docs       | on          | off, unless `ENABLE_DOCS=true` |

## Email

Email verification stays off until `RESEND_API_KEY` is set. The stack runs with
no Resend account. Add the key and Better Auth sends the welcome template from
`packages/transactional/src/emails/welcome.tsx`.

## Conventions

- Absolute imports. Every package maps `@/*` to its own `src/*`.
- `verbatimModuleSyntax` is on in every workspace.
- Biome formats code, JSON, and CSS. Prettier formats Markdown and YAML,
  because Biome does not read those.
- Lefthook runs Biome and Prettier before a commit, and `typecheck` before a
  push.

## Data rules

Four libraries cover data work. Each has one job.

| Need                           | Use                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Transform, group, or fold data | `@mobily/ts-belt` (v4 release candidate) |
| Branch on a shape or a union   | `ts-pattern`                             |
| Read or format a date          | `date-fns`, through `@halo/core/date`    |
| Hold or compute an amount      | `@halo/core/money`                       |

Three rules go with them.

1. **Data is read-only in the browser.** An island renders what it is given. It
   never rewrites a collection in place.
2. **Aggregation happens on the server.** Sums, group-bys, and joins run in the
   API where the data comes from, not in a component.
3. **Money is never a float.** An amount is a bigint of minor units in Postgres
   and a `Money` value in code. `moneyColumn()` in the schema and
   `toMinorUnits` / `fromMinorUnits` in `@halo/core/money` are the only bridge.

```ts
const price = money({ amount: 1234n, currency: USD }); // $12.34
const shares = split(price, [1n, 1n, 1n]); // no cent is lost
```

`match` from `ts-pattern` replaces a chain of `if`. Use `.exhaustive()` so a new
case in a union becomes a type error instead of a silent fall-through.

## UI

`packages/ui` holds the design system. The shadcn CLI writes into it, over Base
UI rather than Radix.

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component> -c packages/ui
```

The app imports one component per path, so nothing unused is bundled:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@halo/ui/button";
import { Reveal } from "@halo/ui/reveal";
```

- **Icons** come from `@phosphor-icons/react`. Import the `*Icon` name, such as
  `XIcon`. The bare name is deprecated.
- **Motion** comes from `motion`. Wrap an animated island in `MotionProvider`
  and build entrances with `Reveal`.
- **Reduced motion** is honoured twice: `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` for
  React animation, and a `prefers-reduced-motion` block in `globals.css` for
  every CSS transition and keyframe. You do not opt in per component.
- **Fonts** are Inter for sans, JetBrains Mono for mono, and Merriweather for
  serif. Astro downloads them at build time and serves them from our own origin,
  so no request leaves for a font CDN.

## Tests

Vitest runs per package, so Turbo caches each result on its own.

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm --filter @halo/core test:watch
```

`packages/core` and `packages/api` run on Node. `packages/ui` runs on jsdom with
Testing Library. `vitest.shared.ts` at the root holds the settings they share.

## Commits

Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
Lefthook checks the message, and CI checks every commit in a pull request.

```bash
pnpm commit
```

The prompt limits the scope to one of: `web`, `api`, `auth`, `db`, `ui`, `core`,
`email`, `ci`, `deps`, `repo`.

## Releases

release-please reads the commits on `main` and keeps a release pull request open
with the next version and the changelog entries. Merge that pull request to cut
a release.

1. A pull request into `main` runs lint, format, types, tests, build, and the
   commit message check.
2. Merging the release pull request tags the version and writes `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. The tag runs the full check again, applies the database migrations, then
   deploys to Cloudflare.

Set these repository secrets before the first release:

| Secret                  | Used for                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`  | `wrangler deploy`               |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | `wrangler deploy`               |
| `DATABASE_URL`          | `drizzle-kit migrate` on deploy |

## Pages and the session

Three pages, all rendered per request because each one depends on the reader.

| Path       | Who can open it | Behaviour                                  |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/`        | Signed in       | Signed-out readers go to `/sign-in?next=…` |
| `/sign-in` | Signed out      | Signed-in readers go to `/`                |
| `/sign-up` | Signed out      | Signed-in readers go to `/`                |

`src/middleware.ts` reads the session once per request, puts the user on
`Astro.locals`, and applies the guard. The page passes that user into the island
as a prop, so the panel never flashes a signed-out state before hydrating.
Every page answer carries `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.

## How the session stays alive

There is no refresh token here, and none is needed. Better Auth uses a **rolling
database session**: an opaque token in an HttpOnly cookie, with a row in the
`session` table that holds `expiresAt`.

Reading the session is what renews it.

1. A request arrives with the session cookie.
2. If the session is older than `updateAge` (1 day), Better Auth pushes
   `expiresAt` out to now + `expiresIn` (30 days) and re-sets the cookie.
3. If it is not that old yet, nothing is written.

So an active reader is never signed out, and an idle one has 30 days. A JWT
access and refresh token pair solves a different problem: it lets a stateless
service verify a token without asking the database. This app has one origin and
one database, so the cookie is simpler and can be revoked instantly.

Three things keep it working:

- **`src/middleware.ts`** reads the session on every page request, which renews
  it as a side effect.
- **`useSession()`** refetches on window focus, on reconnect, and every four
  minutes, which is just under the five minute cookie cache. An open tab
  therefore keeps its own session alive.
- **"Keep me signed in"** maps to Better Auth's `rememberMe`. Unchecked, the
  cookie dies when the browser closes.

Tune the window in `packages/auth/src/index.ts`.

## Forms and data fetching

Forms use React Hook Form with a Zod resolver. Fields bind through `control` and
the design system's `FormField`, never by spreading `register()` onto an input.

```tsx
<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="email"
  label="Email"
  render={(field) => <Input {...field} type="email" />}
/>
```

Data fetching uses TanStack Query. Each query and mutation is a hook in its own
directory, so a component reads as a list of capabilities:

```tsx
const health = useHealth();
const session = useSession();
const signOut = useSignOut();
```

Every key comes from the factory in `@halo/core/query-keys`. Do not write an
inline `["session"]` array anywhere: keys drift, and a cache read then stops
matching the cache write. `queryFn` is the one place the frontend throws,
because TanStack Query turns a throw into error state for the UI.
